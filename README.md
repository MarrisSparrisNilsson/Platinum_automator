# Platinum_automator
A Python project focused on making gameplay automated in Pokémon Platinum

## Description / Background
The goal with this project is to be more familiar with python as I've never coded in this
language before. It's also an exercise to start working with automation. So for this exercise I will try to make
an automation process for the Pokémon Platinum game where all sorts of things could be automated.

## Tools and Libraries

> ### PyAutoGUI
> 
> This library will be used to generate I/O into Desmume (Nintendo DS emulator).
>
> It can locate things on the screen with different functions and give back coordinates that can be used for 
> certain calculations. 
>
> It can also generate keyboard presses which will be used to control most stuff happening in the game and the emulator.
